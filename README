Please note
  - Sanitizer_JS only cleans up markup! If you allow script tags or style attributes, you are responsible for sanitizing them!
  - If you are using Sanitizer_JS on the server side, you are responsible for HTML parsing. Sanitizer _JS expects a valid DOM tree.

Known Limitations
The style attribute is always dropped on Internet Explorer 5-7.
